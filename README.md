# project_scrum

... adds scrum functionality (like User Stories, sprints, scrum roles, etc) to the default Odoo project management module (which it also depends on naturally).

In order to run "project_scrum" you need to have the pyhton library "Beautiful Soup" (python-bs4) installed on your system.
You can do that by the following command: sudo apt-get install python-bs4

The project_scrum module depends on an OCA module (https://github.com/OCA/project/tree/14.0/project_category). This will replace the project category model. The user can create a Task from Sprint by clicking on the Action in the formview. This task is intended to be used as test-case.
